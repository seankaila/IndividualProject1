# IndividualProject: Hero App

## Berif 
This project was inteded to demonstrate the knowledge from the first four weeks of training with QA. To do this I was tasked to create a CRUD application using C# & ASP.NET, testing the application though unit testing & deploying the application using a CL server and Azure App Service. All supported using project management tools for example: A Kanban Board. 

## Architecture

### Database ERD

This is my database structure that was implamented to the project. As you can see the data base consits of two tables (Hero Table & Team Table). These tables have a one to many relationship meaning, a team can have many heros but a hero can only have one team associated with it. These tables are linked with their respected Primary and forigen keys and each element in the table has their respected data type added next to it.

Highlighted in Red was a third table that was deemed out of scope due to time constriates.

This use Case diagram demonstrates what the end user would do with the curd application i have made. The end user will have the ability to add, edit, delete and view a team within the application. The users will also be able to view all the heroes within a team. The user will also have the ability to add, edit, delete and view all the heores within the app. Additionally they will have the ability to exted the Heros details allowing them to view all the details associated with that hero. This helped me diagram helped me develop the Epics, User stories and Tasks in the project management section.
